# Robust-LQR-trajectory-control-for-AR.Drone-2.0

This is my undergraduate thesis project, where a robust trajectory control of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) AR.Drone-2.0 was projected. The control strategy used was an robust optimal control LQR considering polytope uncertains and designed using LMI toolbox in Matlab.

The detailed work explanation can be found in the written thesis pdf file available here.
