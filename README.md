# Robust-LQR-trajectory-control-for-AR.Drone-2.0

This is my graduation project, where a robust trajectory control of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) AR.Drone-2.0 was designed. The control strategy used was a robust optimal control LQR considering polytopic uncertainties and designed using the LMI toolbox in Matlab.

A detailed explanation of the work can be found in the pdf file of the written thesis available here.
